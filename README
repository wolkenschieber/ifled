InterfaceLED README file.

What is it?
-----------
InterfaceLED is a program that uses the keybord LEDs to indicated various
things about a specified interface. For example if a network card is sending
or receiveing data.


How do i install it?
--------------------
Put it into /usr/bin, /usr/sbin or some other directory.


How do i use it?
----------------
Just run "ifled [tty here] [interface here]" to use the default settings.
Use "console" as tty to use the current tty, as interface use the interface you
would like to monitor eg: eth0, ppp0. To run the ifled in background add -f to
the command line.

Example command:
ifled console eth0 -f

You will probebly need to run ifled as root user.


How do i config the LEDs? / How do i get ifled not to touch my num-lock etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look in the list of options from the help (start ifled with no arguments).
For exmaple "-c crt" will make num-lock indicate collisions, caps-lock indicate
receiveing of data and scroll-lock indicate transmitting of data.

A popular LED config is "-c nna" this will make num-lock and caps-lock work as
normal (hopefully) and scroll-lock indicate activity (the interface is
receiving or transmitting data)

Note: You can't use arguments like "-ic nna", use "-i -c nna" insted. 


How do i get the none option to work in console?
------------------------------------------------
If you can't use your (num,caps,scroll)-lock as normal when you use the none
option on them, try the "-a" option it may work.


How do i get the none option to work in X?
------------------------------------------
Run ifled before you start X with the same terminal and same user that you will
start X with, this seams to work. Any other solution?, mail me.


The keybord is weird, keys get stuck etc
----------------------------------------
Try to increase the LED update delay by use the -d parameter. 100ms should
solve the problem, if not try to increase even more. Note that the LEDs will
flash slower at higher LED update delays.


How to i monitor more then one interface?
-----------------------------------------
Use the "n" option with the "-c" parameter for example:

./ifled console eth0 -c nna -f  // Scroll-lock will flash on activity on eth0
./ifled console eth1 -c nan -f  // Caps-lcok will flash on activity on eth1
./ifled console eth2 -c ann -f  // Num-lock will flash on activity on eth2


The LEDs does not work on some terminals
----------------------------------------
A user in most cases can't change the LED status on a terminal owned by another
user even if you run ifled as root user, and I don't know why.

Do you know more about this? Mail me.


The terminal LEDs gets fu*ked up after i have run ifled
-------------------------------------------------------
Try to type "reset", this will do a terminal initialization.


Have fun!, and remember to look away every half hour.
